\subsection{Opacity Due to Bound-Free Absorption}
Bound-free \h\ provides the dominant contribution to opacity in the
solar atmosphere for photons in the near-infrared (with wavelength $\lambda
\gtrsim 1.6 \mu$m) and optical regimes, and provides a significant
contribution to opacity in the near-ultraviolet regime (Balmer
absorption becomes significant in this regime); since the solar
emission spectrum peaks in this range of wavelengths \h\ opacity
affects a key portion of the light coming from the sun.

\cite{wishart1979} calculates the bound-free photoionization
cross-section of \h\ using close-coupling plus correlation
wavefunctions as a function of photon
over the wavelength range 1250-16300 \AA.  The cross-sections given
in that reference are accurate to within 1\%.
The calculated cross sections are shown as the points in
figure~\ref{fig:bfcrosssection}; the lines connecting the points are a
cubic spline interpolation.  The right side of the figure shows the
cross-section for photons with energies close to the $0.754$ eV
sufficient to ``ionize'' the \h ion to become H.  The cross-section
peaks at $\sim 8500$ \AA\ and then decreases with increasing photon
energy.  It is interesting to note that this cross-section peaks in
the optical with large values in the near infrared and near
ultraviolet, just as does solar spectrum.  Hence, the \h\ opacity is
most relevant is the regime of photon energies where the sun's own
photon production peaks.  This coincidence causes the \h\ opacity to
be even more dominant in the sun than would be in stars with similar \h\
densities in their photospheres but with an emission energy spectrum
peaking outside the optical regime.

cross-section of \h. Tabulated values calculated
by \cite{wishart1979} are given as open circles with a cubic spline
interpolation shown as the line connecting the points.  The calculated
cross-sections span from near infrared (at the wavelengths where photon
energies are sufficiently high to ionize the least bound electron
of \h) to near ultraviolet.}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:bohmopacity} shows  opacity as a function of wavelength over the range of wavelengths where \h\ bound-free opacities are relevant for a theoretical solar-like star.  At high wavelengths, past the $\sim 1.6 \mu$m cutoff for \h\ opacity, free-free interactions with \h\ dominate the opacity (the H in the figure is a typo, it should be \h), while at lower wavelengths Balmer bound-free absorption begins to dominate the opacity.

\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:bfcrosssection} and \ref{fig:bohmopacity} both show
that the opacity does not have a discontinuity at the $\sim 1.6\mu$m
cutoff value for \h\ ionization (ionization from a negatively
charged species to a neutral species, that is) as would be expected and is indeed
seen for other species being ionized.  Figure~\ref{fig:bethe} (taken
from \citealt{bethe1977}) shows $\sigma$ as a function of photon
frequency relative to the frequency corresponding to the ionization
energy $\nu$ for H, He, and \h.  H and He both show a large
cross-section right at the threshold frequency which decays with
increasing frequency; \h, however, shows a small cross-section right
at the threshold which increases and reaches a maximum at
$\nu/\nu_{thr}\sim$1.7.  \cite{rau1996} explains this in terms of basic
quantum mechanics and angular momentum.  After a photon is absorbed by
\h\ the electron departs in a $p$-wave.  In the ground state of \h,
however, both the electrons are in the $s$ orbital.  Thus there is an
angular momentum barrier that must be overcome, via quantum
tunneling.  Just above the ionization threshold electrons have low
energy and see the angular momentum barrier as the longest range
potential; the probabilities associated with tunneling through this
barrier thus affect the cross-section at these low energies.  This is not the case for neutral atoms, where the Coulomb
potential is the longest-range potential.  This potential has no dependence on angular momentum and, as such, there is no angular dependence in the cross-section.

  frequency relative to frequency of a photon with energy

\subsection{Opacity Due to Free-Free Absorption}
At wavelengths greater than $\sim1.6\mu$m free-free absorption on \h\ provides a significant contribution to the opacity.  Free-free absorption, also known as inverse bremsstrahlung absorption, is the process by which an electron absorbs a photon in the presence of an atom or ion.  For \h\ the process is
\beq
\gamma + e^- + H^- \rightarrow e^- + H^-.
\eeq
\cite{bell1987} calculate the absorption coefficient for free-free
absorption on \h\ for various temperatures.  They include s
$\leftrightarrow$ p and p $\leftrightarrow$ d transition contributions
only, saying that contributions from higher partial waves are
negligible.  They use the notation $\theta=5040 /T$ ($T$ in Kelvin). Their calculations are shown in table~\ref{tab:freefreetable}.  It is worth noting that the free-free absorption coefficient increases with increasing wavelength, allowing it to contribute significantly to the opacity at wavelengths longer than the $\sim 1.6\mu$m cutoff for \h\ bound-free absorption.  The absorption coefficient also increases with decreasing temperature (represented by increasing $\theta$).  For reference purposes,  the sun has $\theta=0.87$.
\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:freefreetable}\h\ free-free absorption coefficient as calculated by \cite{bell1987}}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/freefreetable.png}
\end{table}

This brings up the question about how the absorption coefficient
contribution from \h\ changes at $\sim 1.6 \mu$m, where bound-free
absorption becomes relevant and the two contributions to opacity start
to overlap.  Table~\ref{tab:boundfreecomp}, taken from \cite{bell1975}
provides a partial answer.  Please note in
table~\ref{tab:boundfreecomp} that the top line beginning with
$\lambda$ should read ``$\lambda(\AA)\theta=$''. The $\theta$ is not
clear in the grainy rendition of the table.  This is the same $\theta$
as in table~\ref{tab:freefreetable}.  Moving from 18225 \AA\ to 15188
\AA, over the wavelength range where bound-free absorption starts to
become relevant, the coefficient for $\theta=$0.8
decreases\footnote{Although the exact nature of the decrease for
  $\theta=$0.8 is hidden in the low wavelength resolution of the
  table, over the range of $\sim$300 \AA between 18225 \AA\ to 15188
  \AA\ the coefficient may reach a minimum and start to increase again
  and still produce the numbers we see in
  table~\ref{tab:boundfreecomp}.} while for all the other $\theta$ it
increases, although in some cases only modestly. Larger $\theta$,
corresponding to lower temperature, produce a larger increase in the
absorption coefficient in this range.  The modest increase at higher
temperatures may seem puzzling at first but a quick review of
figure~\ref{fig:bethe} reminds us that the bound-free absorption
cross-section for \h\ does not exhibit a sudden jump at the cutoff
wavelength for ionization as would be seen for other species
undergoing photoionization, but rather increases fairly modestly,
reaching a maximum only at wavelengths less than the cutoff
wavelength.  For the next tabulated value of wavelength,
$\lambda=11391$\AA, all absorption coefficients are shown to be
increasing and they continue to increase through $\lambda=9113$\AA.  This table reflects the somewhat gradual transition from \h\ free-free absorption to \h\ bound-free absorption as being the dominant contribution of \h\ to the opacity, as can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:bohmopacity}, in contrast with the sudden increase in opacity from Balmer bound-free absorption seen in the same figure.
\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:boundfreecomp}\h\ total absorption coefficient as calculated by \cite{bell1975}}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/freeandboundtable.png}
\end{table}

It would be nice to compare directly the values of
table~\ref{tab:freefreetable} with those used to generate
figure~\ref{fig:bfcrosssection} but they are in different units so
direct comparison is not possible as is.  However, \cite{chandra1946}
provide an early theoretical calculation of the total absorption
coefficient due to both free-free and bound-free absorptions for \h,
shown in figure~\ref{fig:chandratotal}.  They reference an equation
used to calculate the free-free opacity, found in \cite{chandra1945}
\begin{equation}
\kappa = \frac{3.7062}{k(k^2+0.05512)}\left\lvert \int_0^{\infty}W)x(r)\chi_1(r)dr \right\rvert^2 \times 10^{-18} \textrm{cm}^2
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the momentum of the ejected electron in atomic units, $W_2(r)$ is a certain weight function which can be tabulated (values are shown in \citealt{chandra1945}, and $\chi_1(r)$ is the radial part of a p-spherical wave in the Hartree field of a hydrogen atom which tends to unit amplitude at infinity.

In figure~\ref{fig:chandratotal} the total
absorption coefficient has a local minimum around $\sim1.65\mu$m,
consistent with the cutoff wavelength for \h\ bound-free absorption (at $T$=6300 K).  Thus, although the bound-free contribution is smaller than the free-free contribution around the cutoff wavelength, it immediately begins to have a significant effect on the total absorption coefficient, at $T$=6300 K at least.  Figure~\ref{fig:bohmopacity} shows a minimum somewhere between $\sim$14000-16000\AA\ for \cite{boehm1989} calculation of the opacity at $T$=5600 K and $P_e=1.0$.  She also makes the comment that the sum of the free-free and bound-free contributions to the opacity has a minimum between $\sim$16000-16500\AA. Thus it appears that, for the sun, the bound-free contribution to the absorption coefficient becomes significant either right at or within a few hundred \AA ngstrom of the cutoff wavelength.

%M&B and W&W correspond to earlier determinations of the same quantities, by Massey and Bates (bound-free) and  \cite{wheeler1942} (free-free) respectively. No further reference to Massey and Bates other than their names could be found in \cite{chandra1946}.
