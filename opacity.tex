\h\ is the dominant contribution to opacity in the solar atmosphere for photons in the infrared (with wavelength $\lambda \gtrsim 1.6 \mu$m), optical, and ultraviolet regimes; since the solar luminosity peaks in this wavelength range \h\ opacity affects a significant portion of the light coming from the sun.
