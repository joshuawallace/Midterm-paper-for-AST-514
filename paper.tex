\begin{abstract}
A review of H$^-$ in stellar atmospheres. \h\ provides the dominant
contribution to photospheric opacity in the sun for visible and
near-infrared wavelengths and a significant contribution for
near-ultraviolet wavelengths through both bound-free and free-free absorption.  The dominance of \h\ opacity at these
wavelengths is not a ubiquitous feature of all stars but is sensitive
to \h\ abundance, which is in turn affected by photospheric
temperature and the presence of free electron donors in the form of
low ionization potential metals.  The Saha ionization equation is used
to calculate the relative contributions of various atoms to the
electron number density in the solar photosphere, with alkali and alkaline earth metals shown
to be the dominant contributors.  The fraction of \h\ to H is
calculated and compared with H Paschen abundances to explain why
\h\ provides the dominant contribution to opacity in the optical.
The free-free absorption contribution in the near-infrared is also
discussed with special attention paid to the free-free/bound-free
turnover in dominant opacity contribution source.  A brief look at
\h\ in other astrophysical contexts.
